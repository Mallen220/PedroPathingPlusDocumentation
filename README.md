# PedroPathingPlus Documentation Workspace

This repository serves as the **central documentation and reference** project for the
`PedroPathingPlus` ecosystem. It contains utility docs, build scripts, and two
related sub‑projects used by the robotics community:

- **PedroPathingPlus** – an Android/Gradle project implementing pathfinding
  algorithms for FTC robotics.
- **PedroPathingPlusVisualizer** – a Svelte/Vite based visualization tool that
  demonstrates and tests pathfinding behavior.

---

Each subproject is self‑contained but shares reference data updated by the
`npm run ref` script at the root.

### Key Subdirectories
