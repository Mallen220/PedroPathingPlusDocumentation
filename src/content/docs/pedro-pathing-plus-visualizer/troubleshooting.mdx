Encountering an issue with the Visualizer? Here are some of the most common problems and their solutions.

## Installation & Startup

### macOS: "App is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash."
This is a common issue caused by Apple's Gatekeeper quarantining apps not distributed through the Mac App Store.

**Solution:**
1. Move the app to your `Applications` folder.
2. Open the **Terminal** app.
3. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Pedro Pathing Plus Visualizer.app"
   ```
4. Enter your password when prompted and try opening the app again.

### The app opens to a blank screen or fails to load.
This usually happens if the configuration file gets corrupted.

**Solution:**
1. Use the **Reset Keybinds** or **Reset Settings** options in the Command Palette (`Ctrl+P` / `Cmd+P`).
2. Alternatively, you can clear the local storage. Open the developer tools (`Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Shift+I`), go to the Application tab, and clear Local Storage.

## Live View Connectivity

### The Visualizer cannot connect to the robot (Live View).
The Live View server operates over TCP on port **8888**.

**Checklist:**
1. **Network Connection:** Ensure your computer is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the Robot Controller (e.g., the Control Hub's Wi-Fi network).
2. **OpMode Running:** The `PedroPathingLiveView.getInstance().start()` method must be actively running in your initialized OpMode.
3. **Firewall:** Ensure your computer's firewall is not blocking outbound connections to port 8888.

## Path Optimization

### The optimizer crashes or fails to find a valid path.
The Path Optimizer relies on a clear understanding of your robot's size and field obstacles.

**Solutions:**
- **Check Robot Dimensions:** Go to **Settings > Robot** and ensure your robot length and width are realistic (e.g., 18 inches).
- **Check Obstacles:** Make sure you haven't placed obstacles in a way that creates an impossible path (e.g., boxing in the start point).
- **Increase Iterations:** If the path is complex, increase the **Optimization Iterations** in Settings to give the algorithm more time to solve it.

## Code Export

### The exported Java code has red errors regarding missing packages.
When you export Java code, the visualizer uses a default package name, which likely doesn't match your team's project structure.

**Solution:**
1. In the Export dialog, enter your team's specific package name in the **Package Name** field before copying the code (e.g., `org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode.autonomous`).
2. Ensure you have properly installed the PedroPathingPlus libraries in your Gradle project (see the [Installation Guide](/pedro-pathing-plus/installation/)).

### My robot doesn't follow the exported path smoothly.
If the simulation looks smooth but the real robot struggles:

**Solutions:**
- **Tuning:** Ensure your Pedro Pathing PID constants (Translational, Heading, Centripetal) are correctly tuned for your specific drivetrain. The visualizer assumes a perfectly tuned robot.
- **Constraints Match:** Double-check that the max velocity and acceleration settings in the Visualizer's **Motion** settings match the `Constants.java` on your robot. If the visualizer allows unrealistic speeds, the real robot will fail to follow the geometry.
